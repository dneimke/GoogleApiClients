GoogleApiClients
================

A set of code for utilizing the Google API Libraries in applications

Javascript Demo 
---------------
src: https://github.com/dneimke/GoogleApiClients/tree/master/Javascript

The Javascript demo includes a file (Sample.html) which demonstrates the client workflow for using OAuth 2.0 authentication
and validating the resulting Token before calling the Google+ API Service to get a list of Activities.

To run the demo, you will need to:

* Log into your Google Console: https://code.google.com/apis/console to create a client Id.
* Against the Client Id, enter the Redirect Uri and Javascript Origin (e.g. you might use http://localhost:5161 if that's where you were running the demo from)
* While in the Google Console, go to the Services tab and enable the Google+ API service
* Take note of the ClientId and API Key from your Google Console and enter them into appropriate places in the sample (you will find the placeholders near the top of the file)                                                                          

Run your demo!
