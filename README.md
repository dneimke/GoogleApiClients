# README for a newly created project.

There are a couple of things you should do first, before you can use all of Git's power:

  * Add a remote to this project: in the Cloud9 IDE command line, you can execute the following commands
    `git remote add [remote name] [remote url (eg. 'git@github.com:/ajaxorg/node_chat')]` [Enter]
  * Create new files inside your project
  * Add them to to Git by executing the following command
    `git add [file1, file2, file3, ...]` [Enter]
  * Create a commit which can be pushed to the remote you just added
    `git commit -m 'added new files'` [Enter]
  * Push the commit the remote
    `git push [remote name] master` [Enter]

That's it! If this doesn't work for you, please visit the excellent resources from [Github.com](http://help.github.com) and the [Pro Git](http://http://progit.org/book/) book.
If you can't find your answers there, feel free to ask us via Twitter (@cloud9ide), [mailing list](groups.google.com/group/cloud9-ide) or IRC (#cloud9ide on freenode).

Happy coding!

GoogleApiClients
================

A set of code for utilizing the Google API Libraries in applications

Javascript Demo 
---------------
src: https://github.com/dneimke/GoogleApiClients/tree/master/Javascript

The Javascript demo includes a file (Sample.html) which demonstrates the client workflow for using OAuth 2.0 authentication
and validating the resulting Token before calling the Google+ API Service to get a list of Activities.

To run the demo, you will need to:

* Log into your Google Console: https://code.google.com/apis/console to create a client Id.
* Against the Client Id, enter the Redirect Uri and Javascript Origin (e.g. you might use http://localhost:5161 if that's where you were running the demo from)
* While in the Google Console, go to the Services tab and enable the Google+ API service
* Take note of the ClientId and API Key from your Google Console and enter them into appropriate places in the sample (you will find the placeholders near the top of the file)                                                                          

Run your demo!
